# System (Currently can be SB [Spin Boson], HP [Harmonic Potential], FP [Free Particle],
#    MP [Morse Potential], IV [Inverted Gaussian], CP [Coulomb Potential], or HH [Henon-Heiles]. SB works only with MCE, all others with CCS. 
System: CP

#Debug flag [ 0: no debug outputs, 1: debug outputs. Does not really work for dynamic basis set sizes]
debug 0

#Basis Set Generation flag [YES/NO for generating the basis set]
gen YES 

#Basis Set Propagation flag [YES/NO for prop YES
prop YES

#Flag for adaptive altering of the compression parameter in swarms/grid-swarms/train-swarms or the grid spacing for grids. [YES/NO]
cmprss NO

#Propagation method [can be CCS, MCEv1, MCEv2 or MCE12 (uses both MCE methods). No support for AI-MCE, vMCG or 2L-CCS yet.]
method CCS

#Number of repeats. Do not need to set manually - this is set by the run command.

# Compression parameter (can be tweaked to allow better norm value, or altered automatically)   Used for swarms/swarm-trains/grid-swarms
ALCMP 400

# Flag for adaptive basis set size (yes/no) [Selecting No will give a constant basis set size. This is default behaviour] Used for Grids/grid-swarms

Cloning no

# Basis set trimming parameter. If overlap is less than this value, basis function is removed. Used when nbfadapt = yes
